## Notes API
<Date date={'2024-01-09T00:00Z'} />

We have introduced the Notes API to help you manage notes for agents, knowledge bases, and files. You can also use notes to store general information and use them as a blog or wiki.

<Button href="/api-reference/notes" arrow="right">
    <>Notes API Documentation</>
  </Button>

**Key Features:**
- Add notes to agents, knowledge bases, and files.
- Add metadata to notes to store additional information.
- Retrieve notes by resource type and ID.

**Additional Notes:**
- You can use the Notes API like a blog or wiki to store and retrieve information.
- Notes can be used to store custom JSON data for additional context.
- You can use a NoSQL database to store notes and retrieve them later.


## Files API
<Date date={'2024-12-11T00:00Z'} />

We have introduced the Files API to streamline file management in the AI Library.

<Button href="/api-reference/files" arrow="right">
    <>Files API Documentation</>
  </Button>

**Key Features:**

The Files API now serves as both a storage service and a direct upload interface to a knowledge base, eliminating the need for multiple API calls. This simplifies file handling and reduces management overhead.

**Two Ways to Upload Files to a Knowledge Base:**

1. **Recommended:** Use the `POST /v1/files` endpoint to upload files. Specify the knowledge base ID as a parameter. The API will:
   - Upload the file to your account.
   - Add it as a source in the specified knowledge base.
   
   Even though the API is asynchronous, the file URL is returned synchronously in the response.

2. Upload files with `POST /v1/files`, then use the `PUT /v1/knowledgebase/{knowledgeId}` endpoint to add the file as a source.

**Additional Notes:**

- Deleting a file does **not** remove it from knowledge bases.
- Storage capacity depends on your AI Library plan.
- Files can also be added to a knowledge base from any publicly accessible URL. Using the Files API is optional.
