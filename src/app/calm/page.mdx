# CALM or Composition to Augment Language Models

CALM is a framework for composing LLM’s. If you have LLM’s specialised for two different tasks, and you have a composite task that you want the LLMs to perform then CALM gives you a way to combine the LLMs rather than train a new LLM for this composite task. 

CALM introduces a small number of trainable parameters over an intermediate layer of representations between the two LLM’s. A case in point is an LLM that chats with the user and an LLM that outputs code given formal language to give a composite model that outputs code given an informal natural language query. The two specialised LLMs can be augmented to learn this composite task.
Document processing solutions can benefit from this because there is usually a model that scans documents for tables, key value pairs etc and another that is a routine LLM for processing natural language queries. The two models can be composed to give a solution for intelligent document processing. 

Note that this is different from RAG which only superficially fine-tunes the model. This is an act of augmenting representations of two models, to perform tasks that are composite, like intelligent document processing.
