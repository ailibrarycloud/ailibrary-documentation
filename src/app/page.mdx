## Understanding AI Agents

AI Library Platform APIs are organised into entities.

1. **Agent** - The highest level is an agent. Unique identifier of an agent is `namespace` A conversation with an agent can be triggered as a text chat or a voice chat. Agents require instructions (eg. you are a sales agent). By default they pick on the LLM's knowledge.
    
2. **Knowledge Base** - If you want to train your agent with custom data, you need to create a knowledge base. You can feed knowledge base from various sources - documents you upload, files on the internet, your database.
    
3. **Forms** - Agents by default can converse on general topics, on knowledge base you specify and follow instructions you provide. However, if you want them to collect structured information, you can use forms. This opens a plethora of new opportunities. You can trigger follow up tasks based on responses you get.
    
4. **Utilities** - Sometimes your agents need special skills, utilities can help you build _super agents_ ðŸ’ª. You can enable your agent to search the web or news, scrape a web page or access data otherwise unavailable by parsing a PDF or handwritten text.
    
5. **Integrations** - If you want to connect your agent to a 3rd party application, you can use AI Library native integrations. There are bidirectional integrations with CRMs, Telephony Providers, Payment Gateways, Messaging Platforms and more.
