    'In this guide, we’ll look at how authentication works. AI Library offers two ways to authenticate your API requests: Basic authentication and OAuth2 with a token.',
}

# Authentication

You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the endpoints in the AI Library API. In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works. {{ className: 'lead' }}

**Always keep your token safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.** Always use environment variables to store your token, and never hardcode it into your application. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Authentication in the ailibrary Python library: 
<CodeGroup title="Python">
```python {{ title: 'Python' }}
import ailibrary as ai

client = ai.AILibrary(
    api_key="your-api-key"
)
# Now you can access all APIs using the client object
agent_response = client.agent.create(title="Hello World")
``` 

</CodeGroup>
{/* ## OAuth2 with bearer token */}

All other API requests should include your API key in an ``X-Library-Key`` HTTP header as follows:

<CodeGroup title="Example Requests">
```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl https://api.ailibrary.ai/v1/generations/771 \
  -H "X-Library-Key: $AILIBRARY_API_KEY"
``` 
```javascript {{ title: 'Node.js' }}
const axios = require('axios');

const headers = {
  "X-Library-Key": process.env.AILIBRARY_API_KEY
}
```

</CodeGroup>

{/* ## Using an SDK

If you use one of our official SDKs, you won't have to worry about any of the above — fetch your access token from the [AI Library dashboard](#) under API settings, and the client library will take care of the rest. All the client libraries use OAuth2 behind the scenes.
