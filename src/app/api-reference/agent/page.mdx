# Agents

Create, manage and invoke conversation with agents. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Agents have three main components {{ className: 'lead' }}

1. Instruction - This is very important as it tells the agent what it is supposed to do. For example, you can tell the agent that it is a sales agent and it should help the user with their purchase. {{ className: 'lead' }}
    
2. Knowledge Base - Agents can be trained on a knowledge base. This is a collection of data that the agent can use to respond to queries. {{ className: 'lead' }}

3. Forms - If you want to collect structured information from the user, you can use forms. {{ className: 'lead' }}
